                    <h3>Area Watchable Wildlife</h3>
                    <p>In 1998, Governor Mike Huckabee officially proclaimed Newton County 
                        the "Elk Capital of Arkansas". Herds of elk roam our river valleys 
                        at Boxley Valley, Steel Creek, Kyle's Landing, Erbie, Ozark, Pruitt, 
                        and Hasty. Many have migrated to private lands and oft times can be 
                        seen along the highways. It's a memorable experience to see and 
                        photograph these magnificent animals. In addition to the elk, Newton 
                        County is home to an incredible variety of wildlife. Beaver, bear and 
                        deer abound along with 60 other species of mammals and you never know 
                        what you'll see so have your camera ready.</p>

                    <h3>Birding</h3>
                    <p>For those who particularly enjoy watching birds, over 200 varieties 
                        have been recorded in Newton County and can be seen through all the 
                        seasons. The Great Blue Heron, Red Tailed Hawks, Ruffed Grouse and 
                        songbirds like the Scarlet Cardinal, Northern Mockingbird, and Orange 
                        and Black Orioles are among some of the permanent residents of Newton 
                        County. During the winter months, a spectacular sight to see, is the 
                        Bald Eagle flying high along the bluffs of the Buffalo River.</p>

                    <h3>Buffalo National River</h3>
                    <p>The Buffalo National River was the nations first national river, rising 
                        high up in our mountains, rushing through white-water stretches and 
                        rolling 132 miles to join the famous White River. Bluffs along the river 
                        are the Ozarks' highest and the towering multicolored cliffs sharply 
                        accent the surrounding wild mountain beauty. Springtime offers white 
                        water rafting, kayaking and canoeing and early summer is the time for 
                        families with children to have a slower paced canoe trip. Floating the 
                        Buffalo is a wonderful experience that offers excitement, relaxation, 
                        fun for the entire family and great memories. Contact any of the following 
                        Canoe Concessionaires for floating reservations and river information.

                    <h3>Caves & Caverns</h3>
                    <p>There are many wild caves in Newton County but it is not recommended you explore them
                       unless you are an experienced caver or have a professional guide. However, there are
                       several caves that have guided tours, such as, Mystic Caverns which offers a 
                       once-in-a-lifetime caving adventure through two of the Ozarks most beautiful caves,
                       Mystic Caverns and Crystal Dome Caverns! Tours leave every 35 - 40 minutes and 
                       take approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. Check out their website at 
                       www.mysticcaverns.com For more caving fun, Hurricane River Cave and Blanchard

                    <p>Hiking is a year round event in Newton County. There are many different trails 
                        with each one offering a totally different experience. Some have caves and 
                        waterfalls, while others have the river, magnificent views or historical sites.

                    <h3>Historical Sites</h3>
                    <p>The Town Square in Jasper is a great place to start your adventures. Its buildings 
                        reveal a native style of architecture and house quaint shops to browse through. 
                        Scattered through out the county are tiny communities like Deer, Mt. Judea, Nail, 
                        Ponca and the Boxley Valley Historical District, each with it's own story to tell. 
                        Some sites are listed on the National Registry of Historic Places.<br/><br/>
                        Native American history and culture also plays a  important role here. Cherokee, 
                        Osage and other tribes were preceded by the paleo-Indian era that dates back about 
                        10,000 years. Bluff shelters and other archeological sites reveal that stirring 
                        history.</p>

                        trails for riding and Steel Creek and Erbie campgrounds may be used to park your 
                        trailers and ride along the Buffalo River. If you don't own a horse but would love

                        so who needs a pool.  The tall bluffs, cool, clear water, sandy beaches 
                        and a beautiful peaceful setting can't be beat.  Some of the favorites 
                        are at Ozark Campgrounds just two miles off Scenic 7 Byway,  
                        the Pruitt Access at the bridge on Hwy 7, three miles north of Little 
                        Switzerland, and in Jasper, at Bradley Park, there is a wonderful spot 
                        on the Little Buffalo River.

                    <h3>Waterfalls</h3>
                    <p>Waterfalls are an awesome site to behold. Watching the water cascade over 
                        the rocky edge, through a rainbow, and into the canyon below makes you 
                        realize just how great the force of water can be and how it can actually 
                        change the face of the landscape around you.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In a recent publication about waterfalls in Arkansas, there were 11 major 
                        falls listed. Seven of those mentioned were in Newton County, beginning with 
                        Hemmed in Hollow, the tallest waterfall in Mid-America. Most of them are "wet 
                        weather" falls so the best time to view them is in the Spring. Some you have
                        to hike to see, like Eden Falls while others like Falling Water Falls are 
                        easily visible from the road. Be sure to have your camera!</p>

                    <h3>Wildflowers</h3>
                    <p>Hundreds of flowering plants and shrubs, some of them quite unusual, are 
                       native to Newton County. The roadsides blaze with color throughout the 
                       year and easily accessible trails in the forest lands that cover over half 
                       of the county, lead to glades of plants, herbs and other treasures of nature.
